# Hbnb Project
Welcome to HBNB! a project where we’re building our own version of AirBnB   from scratch  using Python. This is part of the Holberton School curriculum, and it's all about learning how things work behind the scenes.

## What is it?

Right now, we’re working on:
- Create and manage places, users, reviews, etc.
- Practice writing clean  Python code

Begins the implementation phase of the application based on the design developed on part1.
