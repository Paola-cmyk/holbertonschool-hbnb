# holbertonschool-hbnb: The blueprint

 **Project overview**: HBnB Evolution is a web application inspired by AirBnB, built to handle user sign-ups, property listings, user reviews, etc. This document acts as a detailed technical guide to help during all stages of development.
 This focuses on the following areas:

**System Architecture**: A high-level look at how the application is organized.

**Core Business Logic**: Class diagrams that represent the main entities in the system User.

**API Workflow**: Sequence diagrams that walk through the main API processes.
